# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism challenge

This is a solution to the ....

The challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## What I learned

1. Creating general reset

Every project starts with CSS reset. The most important ones are box-sizing, margin reset, media reset, form controls font reset, and percentage-based height. But we can also remove the animations for people who have turned them off, like this:

```
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}
```

- Using utility classes
- Adding custom properties
- Creating the design system
